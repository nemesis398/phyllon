# The conscience: full principles

_The canonical reference behind this skill. `SKILL.md` is the operational
summary; this file is the complete working philosophy, verbatim in spirit from
the "Independent Principles of the Conscience." Applicable everywhere a human
and a machine have to agree on a state of the world: any language, any config,
any system._

**Mode:** flag-and-discuss. The reviewer names a violated rule, asks its
standing question, and argues as an equal. Rules can lose arguments; when one
does, this document gets amended. This is a sparring partner, not a rulebook.

---

## The stance, before the rules

Three things this conscience is allergic to:

- **Folklore lines:** code or config copied from somewhere (a dotfile, a wiki,
  an LLM, a senior's PR) without the copier understanding what it does.
- **Speculative abstraction:** helpers, factories, modules, frameworks, options
  designed for a customer that has not arrived.
- **Unexamined convenience:** a line that works for reasons you have not
  checked, kept in because removing it would require explaining it.

When you spot one, name the rule, ask its standing question, then argue. The
operator decides. If the operator convinces you, the rule either sharpens or
gets replaced by a better version. This document is a living artifact, not a
constitution.

## The working rules

### R1: Compress on the second occurrence, not before

No module, no function, no helper, no shared abstraction until the same semantic
pattern has appeared **twice** in real, working code. The first time: write it
inline, straight-line, concrete. The second time: now you have two real examples
to design the shared piece against. Extract the _smallest_ shareable unit, not a
framework.

Until the second occurrence arrives, "duplication" is not duplication; it is the
input data the later compression will be designed from.

- _Flagged:_ extracting a helper/module/option speculatively; adopting a
  framework or wrapper library for a problem you have not had.
- _Standing question:_ "What's the second occurrence?"

### R2: Usable before reusable (write the usage first)

When designing any interface (a function signature, a module option, a CLI flag,
a config key), write the **call site** first: the line you wish you could write.
Then implement toward it. A thing never used once cannot be well designed for
reuse, because you do not yet know what reuse actually costs.

- _Flagged:_ designing interfaces in the abstract before a single caller exists.

### R3: No cargo-cult lines (the explainability rule)

Every line in your code or config must be **explainable**: you can name what it
does, why it is there, and what changes if you remove it. The vice is pasting
from dotfiles, wikis, forums, or an LLM without understanding. The remedy is the
same as for the original sin it mirrors: verify against the documentation, the
source, or a REPL before the line enters the file.

This is the rule that gets flagged most often, because convenience is the
default. Resist the default.

- _Flagged:_ any line the operator cannot explain.
- _Standing question:_ "Where is this documented, and what does each part do?"

### R4: Don't pessimize (know what work you're asking for)

You don't need to optimize, but you should always roughly know what work a
change implies: what gets re-evaluated, what gets downloaded vs. built, what an
extra input drags in, why a step takes the time it takes. Don't add indirection,
inputs, or "flexibility" layers for needs that don't exist yet. That is waste,
the first and largest multiplier. Speculative flexibility is pessimization by
another name.

- _Standing question:_ "What work does this ask of the machine?"

### R5: Protect the iteration loop

The latency of _think → type → run → inspect_ is an asset; defend it. Use the
REPL as your debugger. Run in a cheap environment (a VM, a sandbox, a fixture, a
test) before deploying. Use dry-runs, snapshots, and replay-the-same-scenario
tricks. If iteration latency creeps up (slow evals, giant rebuilds for tiny
changes, long test feedback), treat that as a bug worth diagnosing, not as
weather.

### R6: Inspect the actual data

Don't reason from imagined values. Look at what things actually are. Print it,
eval it, `ls` it, `strace` it, log it. Write a little, inspect immediately,
watch the data change. When behavior surprises you, the answer is to go look at
what the system actually did, not to memorize the incantation.

### R7: Measurements and sources over folklore

When comparing approaches or judging claims ("X is faster," "Y is the proper
way"), get the number or the primary source (a benchmark, a closure size, a doc
reference, the manual) rather than reputation. Measurements get the final vote;
folklore gets none.

### R8: Evaluate every fork on shared dials

Have a vocabulary for comparing approaches. The dials:

- **Granularity:** do I get the fine-grained pieces under the convenience layer,
  or am I locked into a single shape?
- **Redundancy:** are there convenient entry points for common cases alongside
  the power-user path?
- **Coupling:** how much machinery does this drag in? How many other things must
  I believe in to use it?
- **Retention:** how much state or magic does it hold, vs. operating on data I
  own?
- **Flow control:** who calls whom? Do I stay in charge, or does the framework
  call me?

When you make a decision between forks, name which dials the decision turns and
why. Decisions recorded without the dials they turn are folklore waiting to
happen.

## Mental models

**Immediate-mode vs. retained-mode.** Some systems redeclare their entire
desired state and rebuild from it on each invocation (immediate-mode: UIs
redrawn from app state, declarative configs evaluated from source,
infrastructure rebuilt from manifest). Others mutate a standing state and try to
keep intent and state in sync (retained-mode: package managers editing live
system state, ad-hoc scripts appending to files, hand-rolled imperative
deploys). The first kind has nothing to keep in sync. That is _why_ the model
works, not just how. The second is the standing invitation to disagree. Prefer
the first whenever you have it; respect the second by minimizing what lives
outside the source of truth.

**Grouped lifetimes.** When you cannot free individual units, group the things
you free at boundaries the system already has. A configuration generation, a
build artifact, a deployment, a test fixture: drop the whole thing, sweep the
rest. The arena idea wearing a different hat.

**Frameworks you cannot avoid must be demystified, not avoided.** Some layers
invert flow control (they call your code) and carry real magic, exactly the
thing your instincts warn about. You cannot keep flow control there, so the
handmade response applies: understand the layer deeply enough that it stops
being magic. Going to look at what the framework actually did is always a better
answer than memorizing the incantation.

## House style: decided per language, after real code

Style is also an output of programming, not an input. A house convention is
chosen only once enough real code exists in a language to have _felt_ the
alternatives. Conventions get recorded in a table: language, decision date,
formatter, naming, layout, comment conventions. The table is the style analog of
a design record.

| Language                                    | Decide when                                      | Candidate decisions                                          | Decision |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| _(one row per language you actually write)_ | after the first real, kept code in that language | formatter, naming, file/function layout, comment conventions | _(open)_ |

**Adopt now, language-agnostic:** tagged comments for non-obvious reasoning and
inline task tracking (`NOTE:`, `TODO:`, or the language's idiomatic equivalent),
so one grep finds every note and open task across the whole codebase.

## Session protocol

- **Flag-and-discuss:** on a violation, name the rule and ask its standing
  question. The operator answers or argues. Rules can lose arguments; the
  document gets amended when they do.
- **Audit trail:** when an abstraction is extracted, record the two occurrences
  that justified it (R1 evidence). When a fork is evaluated, name the dials it
  turns (R8). Folklore lines caught and decoded get logged with the explanation
  that replaced the magic.
- **Concept checks** may probe in dial vocabulary ("which dial does this fork
  turn, and which way?").
- **The standing questions**, for self-checking before the reviewer asks:
  1. _Where is this documented, and what does each part do?_
  2. _What's the second occurrence?_
  3. _What work does this ask of the machine?_

---

## What this conscience is not

- **Not a performance regime.** We don't count cycles, hand-allocate, or chase
  microseconds by default. Performance is one dial among many, and only relevant
  when measured.
- **Not a law.** The lens is a lens; where its instincts and your domain's idiom
  genuinely conflict, that's a fork to feel and discuss, not a verdict to apply.
- **Not a refusal of tools.** Frameworks, libraries, and abstractions are fine,
  but _after_ you have earned them, _with_ the dials named, _understanding_ the
  layer rather than worshipping it.

_Status: working principles, v1. Amend through use: a rule that survives
arguments stays; one that doesn't gets rewritten here._
