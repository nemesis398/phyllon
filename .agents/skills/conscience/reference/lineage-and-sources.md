# Lineage and sources: where the conscience comes from

_Companion to `principles.md`. That file is the working philosophy; this one
traces the intellectual lineage behind it, states where it agrees with
mainstream software engineering, records the honest critiques and boundaries,
and gives an annotated reading list. The point is to hold the stance the way it
asks you to hold code: understood, sourced, and demystified, not worshipped._

_Sourcing discipline: every URL below was verified at time of writing; the web
rots, so uncertain or unconfirmable items are flagged inline. Nothing here is
invented: where a source is real but a URL, quote, or figure could not be
confirmed, it is marked or omitted rather than guessed. Quoted strings are
verbatim; paraphrases carry the tag "(paraphrase)". If you are about to repeat a
name or a number from this school, check it here first._

## 1. The school and its people

**Casey Muratori: compression-oriented programming.** The spine of this
conscience. Muratori's twin essays "Semantic Compression" (2014) and "Complexity
and Granularity" (2014) argue that you improve code by acting like a continuous
PKZip pass over it, reducing duplicated _meaning_, not character count. He
prefers "compress" to "abstract" because, in his framing, abstraction does not
by itself imply anything useful (paraphrase); abstractions emerge from concrete
working code rather than being designed up front. Two verbatim lines anchor R1
and R2: "make your code usable before you try to make it reusable," and "I don't
reuse anything until I have at least two instances of it occurring." The
granularity essay adds the tiering rule, that you should never supply a
higher-level entity that cannot be trivially recreated from a few lower-level
ones (paraphrase), and the cost stance ("the total cost and only the total
cost"). A verified counterweight to the common "compression sacrifices
maintainability" read: Muratori's own claim is that well-compressed code is
_also_ easier to maintain, because every place doing an identical thing goes
through the same path, so a fix lands once (paraphrase; carry this next to the
maintainability concessions in Section 3). His teaching vehicles are Handmade
Hero (a from-scratch game and engine; handmadehero.org now 301-redirects to
mollyrocket.com/handmade, and his current work is Computer Enhance) and refterm
(a deliberately "largely unoptimized" reference terminal renderer). Note on the
refterm number before you repeat it: the headline "~1000x faster than Windows
Terminal" is Muratori's own claim, the widely reshared "100x" is a community
simplification, and the README frames refterm as a floor ("not a maximum to
aspire to"), not a triumph. See Pakkanen's counterweight in Section 3.

**Mike Acton: data-oriented design.** The performance-realist wing. Acton's
CppCon 2014 keynote "Data-Oriented Design and C++" states that the purpose of
all programs is to transform data from one form to another (paraphrase; the
often-quoted "the transformation of data is the only purpose of any program" is
a tightened restatement, not his verbatim wording), and "if you don't understand
the data, you don't understand the problem." His "three big lies" (software is a
platform; code should model the world; code matters more than data; originally
2008, restated 2014) invert the OO default. Practical residue in this
conscience: design for the collection not the instance ("where there is one,
there are many"), pick Structure-of-Arrays vs Array-of-Structures by which
fields a pass actually touches, and design to the real cost model (memory access
dominates). Two techniques from this wing generalize past C:

- **Existential (existence-based) processing**, Richard Fabian's signature DOD
  move: represent an optional or boolean state by _membership in a set or table_
  rather than a per-item flag or null check, which deletes the branch and lets
  you process the whole set uniformly. This ports directly: a row's presence in
  a SQL table _is_ the "active" state; presence in a Python `set` or a sparse
  dict _is_ the flag; no per-item `is_active` column needed.
- **The relational / ECS generalization:** model entities as rows, components as
  columns, systems as queries over them. This is how most non-C developers
  actually meet DOD: Unity DOTS, Bevy, and EnTT are entity-component-system
  frameworks, and the SoA/columnar-store idea is the same shape a columnar
  database or a dataframe already uses.

Richard Fabian's book _Data-Oriented Design_ (2018, free online) systematizes
all of this. Feeds R4 (know the work) and R8 (the dials).

**Jonathan Blow: transmission of low-level craft.** The cultural argument.
Blow's "Preventing the Collapse of Civilization" (DevGAMM Moscow 2019) claims
software is quietly declining because low-level understanding is not being
transmitted between generations of programmers; his Jai language work is the
constructive counterpart. This is the "demystify, don't worship" mental model's
origin: abstractions are fine once earned, but a generation that can only call
frameworks it cannot open has lost something. Counterweight (carry it the way
refterm carries Pakkanen): the decline thesis is vulnerable to survivorship and
nostalgia bias: the old software we remember is the software that survived, and
"things were more rigorous then" is a hard claim to measure. Hold it as a
provocation about _transmission_, not as an established historical fact. Blow
also hosts Carmack's inlining email, tying the two together.

**The arena / region tradition: grouped lifetimes.** The memory face of R1's
discipline and the "grouped lifetimes" mental model. Casey's Handmade Hero Day
14 introduced the permanent-vs-transient storage split (transient memory holds
no authoritative state and can be zeroed and regenerated). Ginger Bill's "Memory
Allocation Strategies" (Part 2) is the canonical arena writeup (allocate by
bumping an offset, free is a no-op, reclaim by resetting). Ryan Fleury's
"Untangling Lifetimes: The Arena Allocator" makes the central move explicit:
bucket allocations that share a lifetime into one arena tied to a boundary the
program already has (per-frame, per-request, per-parse) and free the group in
one motion. This has a rigorous academic ancestor: Tofte and Talpin's
region-based memory management (_Information and Computation_, 1997), a
type-and-effect system inferring region alloc/dealloc with no GC, later brought
to a safe C dialect by Cyclone (PLDI 2002), itself a precursor to Rust's
lifetimes. Paired with ZII ("zero is initialization," popularized by Muratori):
all-zero bytes as a valid default state.

**The live-editing lineage: how R5 is actually built.** R5 ("protect the
iteration loop") is the conscience's own synthesis, and this is the verified
material it rests on. Handmade Hero Day 21–22 demonstrate hot code reloading
(the game logic is a DLL the platform layer reloads without restarting), and Day
23, "Looped Live Code Editing," records the input stream and replays it
deterministically so a change to the core is felt instantly against a fixed
scenario. The structural precondition is exactly Gary Bernhardt's "functional
core, imperative shell": a pure core of the form `(state, input) → new state`
with all IO pushed to a thin shell. Once the core is pure and inputs are
recorded, you can replay the same scenario, hot-swap the core, and never lose
the state you were debugging. That is the concrete, language-independent
machinery behind "defend think → type → run → inspect."

**The immediate-mode lineage: Muratori to Dear ImGui.** The clearest instance of
the immediate-mode-vs-retained-mode model. Muratori coined "Single-path
Immediate Mode GUI" (essay, 2005; technique developed ~2002 on a Granny 3D
viewer at RAD): redeclare desired state each frame from your own data rather
than mutating a persistent object model you must keep in sync. Sean Barrett gave
a parallel print treatment (Game Developer Magazine, Sept 2005). Omar Cornut
built Dear ImGui and its wiki page "About the IMGUI paradigm" carries the
load-bearing correction: immediate mode is _not_ stateless (the library keeps
ephemeral, ID-keyed interaction state), but your application data stays the
single source of truth. The kernel that ports everywhere: make your own data
authoritative, derive views from it, and watch for the identity/key-mismatch
trap.

**Kindred voices: Carmack, suckless, grug, Locality of Behaviour.** The wider
ring that keeps the school from being a games-only cult. John Carmack's 2007
"inlined code" email (hosted by Blow) grounds R3 and R6: "a large fraction of
the flaws in software development are due to programmers not fully understanding
all the possible states their code may execute in"; shrink the state-space you
must reason about. On the file's own read (synthesis, not a sourced ranking),
Carmack is the least absolutist of these voices: he frames inlining as a
convenience-driven judgment call, not a mandate. The practical partner to
Carmack's point is the **Assert / InvalidCodePath / InvalidDefaultCase
discipline** from Handmade Hero (verbatim macros in the cj1128 mirror below):
make invalid states crash loudly at the point they become reachable, and make
the `default:` case of an enum switch an explicit "this should never happen" so
an unhandled variant fails fast instead of silently. It ports to every language:
assert your invariants, and panic/throw on an unhandled case rather than falling
through. Carson Gross contributes two: "The Grug Brained Developer" (defer
factoring until cut-points emerge; say "no" to speculative complexity, which is
pure R1) and "Locality of Behaviour" (co-locate behavior with the unit it acts
on, explicitly a subjective tradeoff against DRY and Separation of Concerns, not
a rule). suckless.org supplies the "every line and dependency is a liability"
minimalism (removed code is progress). These are heuristics from adjacent
traditions, not scripture, which is exactly how the conscience wants them held.

---

## 2. Where it agrees with the mainstream

This school is often heard as a fringe war on abstraction. On the abstraction
question specifically it is not fringe at all: it converges with some of the
most cited names in mainstream software engineering. The disagreements are
narrower than the rhetoric suggests.

- **Rule of Three (Martin Fowler, crediting Don Roberts).** "The third time you
  do something similar, you refactor." Two copies are acceptable; extract on the
  third. Muratori's "I don't reuse anything until I have at least two instances"
  is the same deferred-DRY instinct: compress _at_ recurrence, not before and
  not never. R1 is essentially the Rule of Three with a standing question
  attached.

- **YAGNI (Fowler, 2015).** "You Aren't Gonna Need It" names the cost of
  building for a customer who has not arrived. Fowler's four cost categories
  (build, delay, carry, repair) are a mainstream articulation of the
  conscience's second allergy (speculative abstraction) and of R4's "don't add
  flexibility for needs that don't exist."

- **KISS.** The generic "keep it simple" folk-rule is the low-resolution version
  of the same posture; the conscience's contribution is to make it operational
  (name the dials, ask the standing question) rather than a slogan.

- **The Wrong Abstraction (Sandi Metz, 2016).** Verbatim: "duplication is far
  cheaper than the wrong abstraction." Her repair prescription: when a shared
  abstraction has accreted conditionals, re-inline it back into its callers and
  re-derive ("the fastest way forward is back"). What it repairs is the exact
  failure mode R1 exists to prevent. On this file's read, this is among the
  strongest mainstream endorsements of the whole compression discipline.

- **Simple Made Easy (Rich Hickey, Strange Loop 2011).** Simple (un-complected,
  an objective property) vs easy (at-hand, familiar, subjective). "Complect" =
  to braid together; state complects value and time; objects complect identity,
  value, and behavior. Hickey targets _incidental_ complexity, which is the same
  enemy as the conscience's "unexamined convenience." Divergence: Hickey reaches
  for immutability and data-as-data; the DOD wing reaches for cache-friendly
  layout: different tools, same anti-incidental-complexity aim.

- **A Philosophy of Software Design (John Ousterhout).** "Deep modules" (a
  simple interface hiding substantial implementation) and the definition of
  complexity as anything making a system hard to understand and modify. This is
  where the schools genuinely _diverge_: Ousterhout wants interfaces to conceal
  representation and machine cost; Acton/Muratori want the cost model visible
  and the fine-grained tier reachable (R8's granularity dial). The disagreement
  is real but narrow: both are hunting incidental complexity; they split only on
  whether concealment or exposure serves comprehension better in a given domain.

The honest synthesis: keep the cheap habits universally (no cargo cult, no
speculative abstraction, no gratuitous waste), reserve data-oriented
micro-optimization for measured hot paths, and let comprehensibility lead
wherever change-rate and team-size dominate.

---

## 3. Honest critiques and boundaries

The conscience is a lens, not a law (its own words). Here is where it is
genuinely contested, stated fairly to both sides.

**The microbenchmark objection.** The most rigorous critique is Evan Teran's
"Casey Muratori is wrong about clean code (but he's also right)" (2023). Teran's
verified core point: nearly all the slowness in Muratori's "Clean Code, Horrible
Performance" benchmark comes from _virtual function dispatch specifically_, not
from the other "clean code" rules Casey bundles with it, and
`std::variant`/`std::visit` can match a per-object method-table dispatch,
showing you can drop dispatch cost without abandoning encapsulation. Combined
with Amdahl's law, this grounds the real boundary: a benchmark on a hot,
homogeneous loop does not generalize to a whole program. The Muratori numbers
themselves are genuine but must be quoted with care, and every figure here is an
**x86/C++ microbenchmark that will not reproduce verbatim in another language or
on another machine**: roughly ~35 cycles/shape for virtual dispatch down to ~24
for a switch (about 1.5x, _not_ 2x), roughly 10x from a coefficient-table layout
versus the virtual baseline, ~15x when a second property is added, and 20–25x
with a light AVX path. The often-repeated "25x from a switch" is an
overstatement; treat any precise per-shape cycle count as approximate and
re-measure in your own environment.

**IO-, network-, and business-bound software, and the portable half.** The
10x/cache-line framing is domain-bound to hot, high-volume, homogeneous data
paths. Transplanted onto IO-bound CRUD, request-handling glue, or business logic
that spends its life waiting on a database or the network, the same tactics are
unmeasured micro-optimization: you are shaving nanoseconds off code whose cost
is milliseconds elsewhere. DOD itself says little about IO- or network-bound
systems. But the _portable half_ (non-pessimization, defined against the
**task**, not the machine) applies everywhere, and it is concrete, not a slogan:

- **N+1 queries → batch or join.** One query per row in a loop is the canonical
  waste. Django `select_related`/`prefetch_related`, Rails `includes`, an
  explicit `JOIN`, or a single `WHERE id IN (...)`. Same fix in every stack.
- **Redundant serialization / parsing → parse once, pass the value.**
  Re-`JSON.parse`ing the same payload per call, re-deserializing a config each
  request, re-`json.loads` in a loop. Parse at the boundary, pass the parsed
  object inward.
- **Per-item allocation in a hot loop → reuse the buffer.** Churning a new
  array/list/object per element. Preallocate and reuse (Go `sync.Pool`; a
  hoisted slice; a reused list); in Python prefer a comprehension over repeated
  `append` growth where it is genuinely hot.
- **Recomputed invariants → hoist out of the loop.** Compiling the same regex
  every iteration (Python `re.compile` once; a hoisted JS regex literal),
  recomputing a constant, re-reading an unchanged file.
- **Speculative indirection → inline until the second occurrence (R1).** The
  plugin system, the config-driven strategy map, the extra interface layer for
  the one caller that exists.

None of these need a profiler to justify removing; they are waste against the
task by definition. The machine-specific half (cache layout, SoA, SIMD) is what
waits for a measurement.

**Large-team maintainability.** The benchmark-driven style optimizes a hot
kernel written and owned by an expert. Off that path, where change-rate and
headcount dominate, the concealment that Ousterhout and the "clean code"
tradition prize can be worth more than exposed layout. Muratori concedes this on
SE Radio 577: the shapes example is a tight numeric kernel and maintainability
trade-offs off the hot path are real. (Balance it against his counter-claim in
Section 1: that identical paths going through one code path is itself a
maintainability win. Both are true; they apply in different regions.)

**Prototyping and exploration.** R2 (write the call site first) and R6 (inspect
the actual data) serve exploration well, but the whole non-pessimization posture
presumes you know the task. In genuinely exploratory work, where the data shape
and the problem are both unknown, reaching for the "correct" data-oriented
layout early is itself a form of speculative commitment. The conscience's own R1
protects against this: stay concrete until the second occurrence teaches you the
shape.

**Managed/JIT runtimes.** A cross-language trap worth stating: in JIT/managed
runtimes the compiler may already devirtualize and vectorize, so hand-porting C
tactics (manual tagged unions to dodge dispatch) can be neutral or negative. R7
settles it: measure, don't assume the C result transfers.

**The Muratori vs. Robert C. Martin exchange: contested vs. conceded.**
Documented in the `unclebob/cmuratori-discussion` repo (`cleancodeqa.md`). It
reads as a boundary negotiation, not a knockout, and both men gave ground.

- _Martin conceded:_ Clean Code examples are inefficient at the nanosecond
  level; "the vast majority of software systems require less than 1% of a modern
  processor's power"; "it is economically better for most organizations to
  conserve programmer cycles than computer cycles"; and that he had
  under-weighted performance, promising "more than barely a nod" going forward.
  (Accuracy caveat: the popular "two or three nods" phrasing is an
  embellishment; the source says "more than barely a nod.")
- _Muratori conceded:_ domains differ; the choice is context-driven.
- _Still contested:_ inheritance vs. discriminated unions (Casey's position:
  inheritance leaves you "stuck," unions let you change your mind), and whether
  performance should be the _default_ posture.
- _Agreed:_ "all these issues are human issues. The computer does not care." The
  decision is context-driven.

The fair reading: not a case of one side winning. It maps the boundary the
conscience already respects: keep the cheap universal habits, reserve the
expensive machine-specific ones for where they measurably pay.

**A standing counterweight for refterm itself.** Jussi Pakkanen's "Looking at
the performance of Refterm" (Nibble Stew) is an honest critique from the author
of the Meson build system: refterm shows high idle memory (~351 MB), no idle
rate-limiting, and freezes on some binary input. Cite it whenever refterm is
invoked as an unqualified triumph; the README's own "modern minimum, not a
maximum to aspire to" framing agrees.

- Casey Muratori, "Designing and Evaluating Reusable Components" (2004): origin
  of the five dials (granularity, redundancy, coupling, retention, flow
  control), the three reuse models (layer / engine-framework / component), and
  "integration discontinuity." Also the source of the operational flow-control
  rule: anywhere there is a callback or inheritance, provide an equivalent plain
  API call so an adopter keeps an escape hatch. (Historical note carried in the
  video: there were originally _four_ characteristics; flow control was the
  fifth, added on Chris Hecker's suggestion.)

- Casey Muratori, "Refterm Lecture Part 1: Philosophies of Optimization" (2021),
  the three activities: optimization / non-pessimization / fake optimization.
  <https://youtu.be/pgoetgxecw8>
- Mike Acton, "Data-Oriented Design and C++" (CppCon 2014): the purpose of all
  programs is to transform data; "if you don't understand the data, you don't
  understand the problem." <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc>
- Jonathan Blow, "Preventing the Collapse of Civilization" (DevGAMM Moscow
  2019): low-level craft must be deliberately transmitted (hold with the
  survivorship-bias caveat in Section 1).
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW-SOdj4Kkk> (official English-audio upload:
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3OCFfDStgM>)

  first Jai design talk. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH9VCN6UkyQ>
- Rich Hickey, "Simple Made Easy" (Strange Loop 2011): simple (un-complected) vs
  easy (at-hand); decomplect state and time.
  <https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/>
- Tony Albrecht, "Pitfalls of Object Oriented Programming" (Game Connect: Asia
  Pacific 2009): the classic AoS-to-SoA cache-miss demonstration on real game
  code.
  <https://harmful.cat-v.org/software/OO_programming/_pdf/Pitfalls_of_Object_Oriented_Programming_GCAP_09.pdf>
- SE Radio 577 (host Giovanni Asproni, guest Casey Muratori), "Casey Muratori on
  Clean Code, Horrible Performance?" (2023): where Muratori concedes
  maintainability trade-offs off the hot path.
  <https://se-radio.net/2023/08/se-radio-577-casey-muratori-on-clean-code-horrible-performance/>
- Julian Ceipek, visual transcript of "Designing and Evaluating Reusable
  Components": the five dials enumerated verbatim; useful if you prefer text.
  <https://github.com/jceipek/designing-reusable-components>
- _(uncertain wording)_ Casey Muratori, "Smart-Pointers, RAII, ZII? Becoming an
  N+2 programmer": supports ZII-vs-RAII attribution; exact in-video wording
  unverified. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt1KNDmOYqA>

### Books

- Richard Fabian, _Data-Oriented Design: Software Engineering for Limited
  Resources and Short Schedules_ (2018, ISBN 9781916478701): the systematic DOD
  text; existential processing, the relational/ECS framing. Free online:
  <https://www.dataorienteddesign.com/dodbook/>
- John Ousterhout, _A Philosophy of Software Design_: deep modules; the
  mainstream case for concealment that the DOD wing partly disputes. (Book; no
  canonical free URL.)
- Martin Fowler, _Refactoring_, home of the Rule of Three (attributed to Don
  Roberts): "the third time you do something similar, you refactor." (Book; no
  free URL cited.)

### Repositories

### Courses and series

- Casey Muratori, "Computer, Enhance!" Performance-Aware Programming: teaches
  speed through Waste, Instructions Per Clock, SIMD, Caching, Multithreading, in
  order of accessibility (Waste first, largest, cheapest). Note this ladder is
  native/compiled-oriented x86 framing; in IO-bound or managed contexts the
  ordering is not the right lens. Table of contents:
  <https://www.computerenhance.com/p/table-of-contents>; series intro:
  <https://www.computerenhance.com/p/performance-aware-programming-series>
  - _(paywalled / not independently verified)_ "Waste" prologue post: the
    "biggest, cheapest multiplier" claim lives here but is behind the paywall.
    <https://www.computerenhance.com/p/waste>
- Casey Muratori, Handmade Hero (episode series and code): Day 14
  "Platform-independent Game Memory" (permanent/transient split); Day 21–22 hot
  reload; Day 23 "Looped Live Code Editing" (input recording + looped playback),
  which together are the verified backing for R5.
  <https://guide.handmadehero.org/>
- Gary Bernhardt, "Boundaries" / "functional core, imperative shell": the
  pattern name for the pure-core + IO-shell split that makes hot reload and
  deterministic replay possible. (Talk; cite by name: no single canonical free
  URL verified here.)

### Academic sources (region-based memory, the arena's formal ancestor)

- Mads Tofte & Jean-Pierre Talpin, "Region-Based Memory Management"
  (_Information and Computation_ 132(2), 1997): type-and-effect inference of
  region alloc/dealloc, no GC; implemented in the ML Kit.
  <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540196926139>
- Tofte, Birkedal, Elsman, Hallenberg, "A Retrospective on Region-Based Memory
  Management" (2004), the honest caveat: pure region inference sometimes needed
  hybrid GC.
  <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:LISP.0000029446.78563.a4>
- Grossman, Morrisett, Jim, Hicks, Wang, Cheney, "Region-Based Memory Management
  in Cyclone" (PLDI 2002): statically-checked regions in a safe C dialect; a
  precursor to Rust lifetimes.
  <https://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/cyclone/papers/cyclone-regions.pdf>

### Provenance notes (pure pointers; details live in the sections above)

- **refterm number:** ~1000x is Muratori's own claim, "100x" is a community
  simplification; caveat stated inline at first mention in Section 1.
- **five dials were originally four:** flow control added on Chris Hecker's
  suggestion; stated in the "Designing and Evaluating Reusable Components"
  reading-list entry.
- **"more than barely a nod":** not "two or three nods"; stated in Section 3
  (Martin exchange).
- **Acton "purpose of all programs":** the tight "only purpose" phrasing is a
  restatement, not verbatim; handled in Section 1.
- **Blow decline thesis:** carry the survivorship/nostalgia-bias caveat from
  Section 1.
- **handmadehero.org** 301-redirects to mollyrocket.com/handmade; Handmade Hero
  is retired; current education work is Computer Enhance (computerenhance.com).
- **"Compression-oriented Programming" forum thread** was _opened by user
  "Burmi"_ (2015); Muratori only replied; do not cite as Muratori-authored.
  <https://hero.handmade.network/forums/code-discussion/t/510-compression-oriented_programming>
- **Sean Barrett's parallel immediate-mode treatment** (Game Developer Magazine,
  Sept 2005) is solidly attributed but has no verified online URL, so cite the
  print attribution, not a guessed link.
- _(medium confidence)_ **Allen Webster's** Handmade Network profile is real
  (handle misspelled "Mr4thDimention"); personal site mr4th.com. No single
  citable "how I program" essay verified, so cite his example (build your own
  tools), not a quotation. <https://handmade.network/m/Mr4thDimention>
